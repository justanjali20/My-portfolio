            I am skilled in html,css, javascript and I am also a front end developer 
            I have also done projects on web designing and I have done some certification
            Â courses

            <p className="hero--section-description">
            My journey into front-end development began with a curiosity 
            for how websites are built and evolved into a deep-seated love for coding
             and design. I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always eager to 
             stay up-to-date with the latest frameworks and technologies that enhance user 
             experience and streamline development workflows
